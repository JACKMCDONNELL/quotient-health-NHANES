## **Longevity Score — NHANES Validation Summary (Draft for Internal Review)**

---

## **1. Overview**

This document summarizes the first-pass validation of the **Longevity Score** using NHANES 2015–2016.
My primary goal was to determine how well the score tracks with physiologic vulnerability, measured by a standard **Frailty Index (FI)**.

The following sections include:

* Interpretation of correlation results
* Distributions of both scores
* Quartile analysis
* Cohen’s d effect size
* Figures embedded below for easy reading

## **2. Distribution of Frailty Index**

The frailty index (FI) ranges from 0 to 1. In NHANES, older adults cluster toward the lower end.

### **Frailty Index Distribution**

**Interpretation:**
Frailty is heavily right-skewed, as expected in a general population sample. Most individuals have FI < 0.1.

## **3. Distribution of Longevity Score**

After normalization and credit-score mapping (300–850):

**Interpretation:**
The Longevity Score distributes smoothly with no major artifacts, indicating stable scaling.

## **4. Correlation Between Longevity Score & Frailty Index**

### **Scatter Plot with Trend Line**

![LS vs FI Scatter](fig_ls_fi_scatter.png)

**Key finding:**

* Pearson correlation: **–0.33**
* Higher Longevity Scores tend to correspond to lower frailty levels.

This is consistent with expected relationships between physiological risk scores and frailty constructs.

## **5. Quartile Analysis**

We divided the sample into Longevity Score quartiles (Q1–Q4).

### **Frailty Index Across Longevity Score Quartiles**

**Mean FI by quartile:**

| Quartile            | Mean FI |
| ------------------- | ------- |
| **Q1 (Lowest LS)**  | 0.149   |
| Q2                  | 0.084   |
| Q3                  | 0.055   |
| **Q4 (Highest LS)** | 0.039   |

**Interpretation:**
Frailty burden decreases **monotonically** with improving Longevity Score.
The healthiest quartile shows **3–4× lower frailty** than the least healthy group.

---

## **6. Effect Size (Cohen’s d)**

We dichotomized frailty using the standard cutoff (FI ≥ 0.25 = “frail”).

### **Longevity Score Differences by Frailty Group**

![LS by Frailty Group](fig_ls_frail_groups.png)

* **Cohen’s d = 0.677**

**Interpretation:**
Medium-to-large effect size.
A randomly selected non-frail adult has about a **70% chance** of having a higher Longevity Score than a frail adult.

This is a strong signal for a cross-sectional population dataset.

---

## **7. Summary of Findings**

* The Longevity Score **correlates moderately** with frailty (r ≈ –0.33).
* Quartile analysis shows **clean stepwise separation**.
* The magnitude of difference between frail vs. non-frail adults (**d = 0.677**) is substantial.
* Overall, the score demonstrates promising discriminative performance, even in a non-clinical dataset with limited biomarkers.
