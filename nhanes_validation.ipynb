    "## **Longevity Score — NHANES Validation Summary (Draft for Internal Review)**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "This document summarizes the first-pass validation of the **Longevity Score** using NHANES 2015–2016.\n",
    "My primary goal was to determine how well the score tracks with physiologic vulnerability, measured by a standard **Frailty Index (FI)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Interpretation of correlation results\n",
    "* Distributions of both scores\n",
    "* Quartile analysis\n",
    "* Cohen’s d effect size\n",
    "* Figures embedded below for easy reading\n",
    "\n",
    "As a caveat, several Longevity Score v1.1 components were not available in NHANES 2015–2016 public data. Therefore, the present validation uses a reduced Longevity Score, including only variables available in NHANES. The following components are missing from the dataset and were excluded from modeling:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) score\n",
    "* Bone mineral density (DEXA hip or spine)\n",
    "* Maximal VO₂ max\n",
    "* Heart-rate variability (HRV)\n",
    "* Grip strength\n",
    "* Epigenetic age acceleration (e.g., TruAge)\n",
    "* Small HDL particle count\n",
    "* 2-hour OGTT glucose\n",
    "* ALT (missing in this cycle)\n",
    "* Detailed smoking exposure (pack-years)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because these variables represent key cardiometabolic, functional, and biological aging domains, the NHANES-based LS is expected to have lower discrimination than the full Quotient Health Longevity Score.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Distribution of Frailty Index**\n",
    "\n",
    "The frailty index (FI) ranges from 0 to 1. In NHANES, older adults cluster toward the lower end.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Frailty Index Distribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "![FI Histogram](\"fig_fi_hist.png\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "Frailty is heavily right-skewed, as expected in a general population sample. Most individuals have FI < 0.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Distribution of Longevity Score**\n",
    "\n",
    "After normalization and credit-score mapping (300–850):\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Longevity Score Distribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "![Longevity Histogram](\"fig_ls_hist.png\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "The Longevity Score distributes smoothly with no major artifacts, indicating stable scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Correlation Between Longevity Score & Frailty Index**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Scatter Plot with Trend Line**\n",
    "\n",
    "![LS vs FI Scatter](\"fig_ls_fi_scatter.png\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key finding:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pearson correlation: **–0.33**\n",
    "* Higher Longevity Scores tend to correspond to lower frailty levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is consistent with expected relationships between physiological risk scores and frailty constructs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Quartile Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "We divided the sample into Longevity Score quartiles (Q1–Q4).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Frailty Index Across Longevity Score Quartiles**\n",
    "\n",
    "![Quartile Boxplot](\"fig_ls_fi_quartile.png\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mean FI by quartile:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Quartile            | Mean FI |\n",
    "| ------------------- | ------- |\n",
    "| **Q1 (Lowest LS)**  | 0.149   |\n",
    "| Q2                  | 0.084   |\n",
    "| Q3                  | 0.055   |\n",
    "| **Q4 (Highest LS)** | 0.039   |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "Frailty burden decreases **monotonically** with improving Longevity Score.\n",
    "The healthiest quartile shows **3–4× lower frailty** than the least healthy group.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. Effect Size (Cohen’s d)**\n",
    "\n",
    "We dichotomized frailty using the standard cutoff (FI ≥ 0.25 = “frail”).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Longevity Score Differences by Frailty Group**\n",
    "\n",
    "![LS by Frailty Group](\"fig_ls_frail_groups.png\")\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cohen’s d = 0.677**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "Medium-to-large effect size.\n",
    "A randomly selected non-frail adult has about a **70% chance** of having a higher Longevity Score than a frail adult.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a strong signal for a cross-sectional population dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **7. Summary of Findings**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Longevity Score **correlates moderately** with frailty (r ≈ –0.33).\n",
    "* Quartile analysis shows **clean stepwise separation**.\n",
    "* The magnitude of difference between frail vs. non-frail adults (**d = 0.677**) is substantial.\n",
    "* Overall, the score demonstrates promising discriminative performance, even in a non-clinical dataset with limited biomarkers.\n",
